Audio examples:

1. Laborintus 23
This poem is written in very long free verses and there are some indented lines. Mapping the three audio streams in the stereo front (alphabetical to the left, extra-alphabetical to the right, blank to the center), information about structure becomes more evident, as well as the opposition between alphabetical and extra-alphabetical characters. This poem contains words in some foreign languages, including  Greek. Greek characters are clearly distinguishable from the Latin ones by two different periodic sound sources. There are also some words written in capital letters, identifiable by the different harmonic spectre. Sound iteration is less relevant, except for some cases mostly referred to Greek words.

2. Stracciafoglio 46
The discussion about this poem is similar to the previous one for what concerns structure and extra-alphabetical component, but this composition often sounds more like a song, as sound repetitions convey some kind of rhythmical structure. The first and the last sentences, which start in the same way, contribute to this concept. The result is pleasant, especially in some parts, as it recalls Western music.

3. Pi√®ce en forme de cube
In this poem the long (free) verses are often alternate to the short ones, and there are a lot of indented lines. The most relevant feature is the massive use of extra-alphabetical characters. It also contains a lot of foreign words, so the "multilingual mode" has been selected to highlight letters that are less frequently used in Italian, as their sound is very high-pitched. Accents (i.e. earcons with acciaccatura) within words are relevant for this purpose, too. Because of the high density of information, playback speed in slower. Panning is always the same. Sound repetitions are almost absent.

4. per Tano Brancato
This poem is written in quatrains in which the same words are repeated in a different order every two stanzas. Moreover, these words often contain the same characters. Extra-alphabetical characters, instead, are almost absent. These features are emphasized through panning and different volume levels. Playback speed is also a little faster as the density of information is lower, so structure is highlighted and sound repetitions are still audible.

5. Nespoleide 1
This poem has a regular but original structure made of 2 stanzas (nine and eight lines) followed by a couplet each.
There are a lot of extra-alphabetical characters, mostly numbers: sound iteration, thus, regards both words and numbers. The result is musically pleasant. Volume levels of both alphabetical and extra-alphabetical streams are a little lower to help grasping the structure, yet preserving the other features. Panning is always the same.
